# Termination of Employment
Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of the reasons for termination are routine. Common circumstances under which employment is terminated include the following:

- _Resignation:_ Voluntary employment termination initiated by an employee.
- _Termination:_ Involuntary employment termination initiated by Lullabot Education. In most cases, we will use progressive disciplinary actions before dismissing an employee. Certain actions warrant immediate termination.
- _Layoff:_ Involuntary employment termination initiated by Lullabot Education for non-disciplinary reasons.
- _Retirement:_ Voluntary employee termination upon eligibility for retirement.

Since employment with Lullabot Education is based on mutual consent, both the employee and Lullabot Education have the right to terminate employment at-will, with or without cause, during and after the introductory period.
In the case of employee termination, the employee will receive their accrued pay in accordance with all federal, state and local laws.

Employee benefits will be affected by employment termination in the following manner:
- All accrued vested benefits that are due and payable at termination will be paid in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws.
- Some benefits may be continued at the employee's expense if the employee elects to do so, such as healthcare coverage through COBRA.
- The employee will be notified of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations of such continuation.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, direct them to Human Resources.

## How to quit Lullabot Education
It's always difficult when people leave the company, but we realize that there are any number of reasons why someone may need to leave. People get nervous and embarrassed that they're thinking of leaving. This sometimes leads to a clumsy exit process. Please remember that we've pretty much been through it all and all we ask for is honesty and open communication during these transitions. Lullabot Education may sometimes seem like a family, but it's certainly not a cult, and we realize that people will come and go.

Please consider the following points as you're thinking about giving your notice:

Are you quitting because you're unhappy, unfulfilled, or you're feeling frustrated?

We strive to provide a variety of opportunities for Lullabot employees. We want to find the right fit for everyone and we're willing to shift people around if their current roles and tasks aren't working.

### Unhappy? Talk to someone
First and foremost, we want happy team members. If there is anything we can do to keep/create your happiness, please let us know. If you are worried about confidentiality, the CEO and/or the Insperity HR specialits are available anytime to listen and/or to help provide advice and coaching. 

### Some steps to take before you leave
#### Give advance notice
Please give notice as soon as you know you are leaving. A minimum of 2 weeks is appreciated.
#### Tie up loose ends 
Forward your email, catch up your voicemail, reassign your Google docs, etc.
#### Work with HR for a resignation plan
Knowing when your last day is helps us plan for your and Lullabot Education's future. We can work together to decide on when permissions will be removed, if/when COBRA starts, and more.
#### Last paycheck details
We will provide for you the details of your last paycheck, and when to expect it (varies by state). Your last paycheck could include: any PTO owed/deducted, a $1 PEX withholding (as per the PEX policy), and any reimbursements due.
#### Turn in your "keys"
Please mail any Lullabot Education property/documents to the Providence office and destroy your Lullabot Education credit card.
#### Exit interview
Upon leaving the company, Lullabot Education would love to hear your feedback. The CEO will contact you for an exit interview.

Please be reminded of the contract and other NDA terms as they relate to termination.
