# Your First 90 Days
The first 90 days with Lullabot Education are your "introductory period" where we get to know each other and evaluate if this is a good fit on both sides. You'll settle into your roles and get your own personal work environment running smoothly.

## Workload
As you get more comfortable with your roles on the team, you will be better able to determine your workload in a given week. We do not set or track your time, and you are responsible for distributing your workload as needed to get your tasks done. As a team, we try to make priorities clear and then let people dive into the work in the way that they feel best serves the company priorities. When you are unclear where to focus your energy, it is your responsibility to raise a hand and ask the team for guidance.

## The First Month
In your first month you will have weekly check-in calls with the CEO. You'll be learning the ropes and getting up to speed, with a lot of direction for what to focus on each week, and feedback on your work. The team will work with you to help you figure out how to shine and feel confident. This goes for daily tasks, as well as sorting out things like communication tools and your office space setup.

The final weekly check-in will be a 1-month review. This is an opportunity to review your on-boarding experience and give the team feedback for improvements we can make. We'll also provide you with feedback and discuss expectations for the next 2–6 months. During this call we can also figure out what amount of one-on-one check-ins you feel good with. Do you want regular check-in calls? If so, how often? Weekly, monthly, ad hoc, something else? We can keep tweaking the balance, but we want to make sure you feel supported and in contact, while not smothered.

## 90-Day Review
Once you are 90 days in, we expect that you will be well settled into your routine and feeling solid with how we work. You may not have everything nailed down in terms of day-to-day tasks. You probably won't know all the ins-and-outs of your role quite yet. We find that it normally takes someone about 3–6 months to really feel like they are hitting their full stride, which is totally normal and expected.

After 3 months working with the team, we'll have another check-in. This review will take a look at your next 6–12 months. What are your strengths and weaknesses within the context of the team, what gets you excited, how do you want to kick ass, etc.?
