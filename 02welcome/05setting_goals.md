# Setting Goals
Personal goals are not mandatory, but they can be useful. Goals are not meant to be a carrot or a stick for Lullabot Education's employees. If you're here, it's because you're already a responsible adult who's great at what you do. Goals are not meant to be the yardstick that determines success or failure. Our business changes quickly and your goals may need to change in turn. We do not use personal goals as the basis for determining raises, praising or punishing at 3-month or annual reviews, or as a way to push employees to do more with less.

So how do we use goals at Lullabot Education? As is so often the case, it's more about the journey than the destination. Goal-setting can serve as the basis for a valuable dialog with the CEO. If you're feeling uncertain of your responsibilities or what success looks like for your position, goals can be a way to brainstorm and document these things. 

Good quality goals have the following attributes: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). They tend to make the slippery realm of ideas and qualities into something tangible. For instance, let's say you and the CEO agree that it's important for you to work on assertiveness. How can this be measured? A goal might look like the following, "Write a short, one-page essay on what this trait means to you now, and your concerns/experiences with it. Then, at the end of the 6 months, write a follow-up including real-life examples from your experience in the position, describing how you were more or less assertive, and what you've learned about assertiveness by being in a management role." Other goals lend themselves better to metrics such as, "I will complete a Coursera Introduction to Computer Science course and get my certificate of completion as a way to learn Python."

At the end of the day, goals are just a ruler for us to define and measure success, but they're not the only one. They're also completely optional. If you'd like to go through a goal-setting exercise, ask the CEO.
