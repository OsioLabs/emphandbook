# Retirement Plan

Our retirement plan is a defined-contribution 401(k) plan in the U.S. (or equivalent in other countries) that includes up to a 4% match when you contribute a percentage of your salary. If you choose to invest 6% of your salary (pretax), combined with our 4% match, you'll be saving 10% of your income towards retirement. Please note, there is no employer contribution without an employee contribution! If you're not taking advantage of this benefit, you're missing out on additional money for your retirement.

Employees may consult with our representatives and refer to plan documents for more details. U.S. plans are provided by Principal.
