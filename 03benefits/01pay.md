# How Pay Works
An employee's salary is negotiated at the time of hiring, and any significant changes to this base salary outside of the annual increases outlined below are based on conversations between the employee and CEO.

## Annual salary increases
Regular salary adjustments are based on annual performance reviews conducted on or near your original hire date anniversary. Salary increases are solely at the discretion of the CEO and are not guaranteed. Typically, for employees who are performing up to expectations, you will get an increase that is based on a percentage of your existing base salary, in line with average U.S. increase rates and that will normally match or exceed the standard [U.S. SSA Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) rate](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/colasummary.html) for the current year.

## Paydays
U.S. employees are paid on a semi-monthly basis (the 15th and last day of each month). Danish employees are paid on the last day of each month. In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a weekend, employees will be paid on the business day preceding the weekend, unless otherwise required by state or national law.

Lullabot Education pays its employees via direct deposit by default, but if you prefer to receive physical checks this is an option for U.S. employees. You will be provided with log-in information to view your pay stubs and tax information online. If you would like to have your pay stubs mailed to you, contact the CEO and/or Insperity.

## Payroll deductions
Lullabot Education makes deductions from employee pay only in circumstances permitted by applicable law. This includes, but is not limited to, mandatory deductions for income tax withholding, social security and medical system contributions, as well as voluntary deductions for health insurance premiums, pension plans and other related contributions.

If you believe that an improper deduction has been made from your pay, raise the issue with the CEO immediately, who will promptly investigate. If the investigation reveals that you were subjected to an improper deduction from pay, you will be reimbursed promptly.
